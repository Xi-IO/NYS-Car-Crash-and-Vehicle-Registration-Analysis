# NYS Car Crash and Vehicle Registration Analysis

Motor vehicle crashes remain a serious public safety issue. In 2019, over 36,000 people died in traffic crashes across the United States. This project focuses on crash trends in New York State using public datasets to explore how region, time, and human behavior impact crash frequency.

---

## 📊 Overview

This project includes:
- Mapping NY counties into 10 standardized regions
- Visualizing vehicle registration and crash frequencies by region
- Exploring daily and weekly crash patterns
- Analyzing seasonal variation and pedestrian-involved crashes
- Modeling crash trends using linear models and Generalized Additive Models (GAM)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `mgcv`
- **Visualization**: Bar plots, time-series scatter plots, smoothed curves
